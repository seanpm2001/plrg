* Everyone is Welcome!

* @@html:<font color="#a90533">@@Call for Presentations@@html:</font>@@

Please send us ([[./contact.html][Contact]]) a short proposal (informal, one paragraph)
about your presentation.

Possible topics:

+ Present a classic work [fn:1].
+ Talk about your original work like library, language design, etc.
+ Host a tutorial session (for example: how to use a proof assistant).


* Paper Bidding Mechanism (RFC)

We maintain [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NuWy4YpqwUCiR2V9wU1nb7UOKCusfiz1jaHEHUaEg3Y/edit?usp=sharing][a queue of papers]] which every member can contribute to.

Paper selection is bidding-based. Each week we vote for the next
paper to read from the first 3 papers in the paper queue.

* Paper Discussion

+ We expect that every participant at least go through the paper and
  get its main idea before coming to each meeting.
+ We recommend that you bring a physical or electronic copy of the paper.

* COVID & Health

+ It is always recommended to wear a mask when attending in-person meetings.


[fn:1] Not limited to the ones in the paper queue.
