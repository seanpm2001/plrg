* About

@@html:<font color="#a90533">@@ The PL Reading Group @@html:</font>@@ (PLRG)
is the de facto successor to PL Wonks and several previous reading groups.
Unlike the PL Wonks talk series, the focus of PLRG is paper reading and discussion.
However, we do occasionally schedule presentations, practice talks, and tutorial
sessions ([[*Schedule]]).

*We are looking for presentations!* Please refer to [[./participation.html][Participation]] for
details about voting for papers and scheduling your presentation.

* Time

+ *Time:* <1:00 PM> on *Tuesdays*.
+ The event usually lasts *1 hour*. You may leave early.
+ If you are a speaker, please make sure your presentation is within *40 minutes*.

* Location

+ *Room:* *BLIF-3069* (conference room, 3rd floor Luddy Hall)
+ Where is it? Search "Luddy Hall" on [[https://map.iu.edu/iub/][Campus Map]].
