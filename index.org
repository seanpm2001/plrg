* About

  The PL Reading Group (/PLRG@IU/) is the de facto successor to PL Wonks and
  several previous reading groups. Unlike PL Wonks events, the focus of PLRG
  is paper reading and discussion. However, we do occasionally schedule talks,
  presentations, and tutorials.

  *@@html:<font color="#a90533">@@Call for Presentations!!@@html:</font>@@*
  
  Please send us ([[*Contact]]) a short proposal (informal; one paragraph) if you
  have an idea, including but not limited to:

  + Presenting a classic work [fn:1].
  + Talking about your original work (library, language design, etc. ).
  + Tutorial (for example, how to use a proof assistant).
  
* Time & Location

  + *Time:* <4:00 PM> on Fridays 
  + *Location:* [[https://registrar.indiana.edu/information/building-codes.shtml][BLI-107]] (/Myles Brand Hall West/, also known as /Info West/, Room 107)
  + Where is it? Search "Myles Brand Hall" on [[https://map.iu.edu/iub/][Campus Map]].

* Participation

  *Everyone is welcome!!*

** Paper Bidding Mechanism (RFC)

   We maintain [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NuWy4YpqwUCiR2V9wU1nb7UOKCusfiz1jaHEHUaEg3Y/edit?usp=sharing][a queue of papers]] where every member can contribute to. New
   proposals are pushed to the rear of the queue.

   Paper selection is bidding-based: we maintain a sliding window with a
   tentative size of 3 (arbitrarily chosen), The window starts from the head
   of the queue. Members select from these 3 papers and vote for the next
   one to read. We then update the queue by popping the winner.
   
** Paper Discussion

   + We expect that every participant read the paper before coming to the discussion
      session. You do not need to understand every detail, but it is recommended that
      you go through the paper and get the main idea.
   + We recommend that you bring a physical or electronic copy of the paper to the
      discussion.

* COVID & Health

  + Due to COVID-19, it *is required* to wear a mask when attending in-person meetings.

* Contact

  + Mailing list: ~pl-reading-iu-group~
  + Email Tianyu (~chen512~) to ask questions and / or to join the mailing list

[fn:1] Not limited to the ones in the paper queue.
