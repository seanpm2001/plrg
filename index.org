* About

  The PL Reading Group (/PLRG@IU/) is the de facto successor to PL Wonks and
  several previous reading groups.

  Unlike PL Wonks events, the focus of PLRG is paper reading and discussion.
  However, we do occasionally schedule talks. Please send us ([[*Contact]])
  a short talk proposal (informal; one paragraph) if you have an idea!

* Time & Location

  TBA

* Participation

  + *Everyone is welcome!!*

** Paper Bidding Mechanism (RFC)

   We maintain a queue of papers where every member can contribute to. New
   proposals are pushed to the rear of the queue.

   Paper selection is bidding-based: we maintain a sliding window with a
   tentative size of 3 (arbitrarily chosen), The window starts from the head
   of the queue. Members select from these 3 papers and vote for the next
   one to read. We then update the queue by popping the winner.

   *[NOTE]* The paper for <2021-11-12 Fri> is pre-selected to get things going.
   
** Paper Discussion

   We expect that every participant read the paper before coming to the discussion
   session. You do not need to understand every detail, but it is recommended that
   you go through the paper and get the main idea.

   We recommend that you bring a physical or electronic copy of the paper to the
   discussion.
