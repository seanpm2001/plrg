Theme is credited to https://olmon.gitlab.io/org-themes/ .

To contribute:

* Edit the Org files
* Run `make clean && make` to regenerate the corresponding HTML files
* Commit and push your changes to _both_ the Org files and the HTML files using Git
* If you would like to edit the look of the website, `white_clean.css` is what
  you're looking for. The `white_clean.theme` is used to inject HTML headers.
  Do not edit `white_clean.theme` unless you're 100% sure what you're doing.
* If a new semester begins, archive the old `index.html`. You can then directly override
  the old Org file with new contents and regenerate HTML.
